           <div class="div-text odd-box"><h2>Travel advice</h2>
            <p>With global recovery on the horizon, keen traveler's worldwide are planning their next trip. Across India, hotels, restaurants and tourism attractions are taking concrete steps to reopen safely, with new protocols designed to ensure the health of all visitors.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="div-text even-box"> <h2>Stay Informed</h2>
                <p>As travel restrictions ease, the best way to ensure you’re up-to-date with the latest advice is to follow government guidelines. You can also visit the ministry's website for the latest news on travel policies.</p></div>
            <div class="div-text odd-box"> <h2>Take charge of your well-being</h2>
                <p>Be responsible for your health. Make sure you feel well before setting off, and do not travel if you don’t. If you begin to experience symptoms of Covid-19, such as a mild cough, fever or shortness of breath, isolate at home and seek medical advice. </p></div>
            <div class="div-text even-box"> <h2>Hygiene first</h2>
                <p>The simplest way to stay safe and protect those around you is through good hygiene. When traveling, wash your hands thoroughly and regularly, and avoid touching your nose and mouth. Carry hand sanitizer and disinfecting wipes when out and about, particularly in more remote or rural locations, and apply regularly. </p> </div>
           <div class="div-text odd-box"> <h2> In transit</h2>
            <p>If you’ve got a short-hop flight across India, or you’re planning to take the train, arrive early. Thanks to new safety measures, such as temperature scans and social distancing, queues may be longer and move more slowly. Where you can, use online check-in facilities, and allow yourself enough time to pass through security screening and board smoothly.</p></div>
           <div class="div-text even-box"> <h2>Accommodation</h2>
            <p>In line with strict new government guidelines, hotels have rolled out enhanced sanitization protocols to safeguard the health of their guests. Properties are also limiting guest numbers, carrying out health screenings on arrival and offering online check-in.  Feel free to phone ahead of your arrival for details on how your hotel is managing this: staff will be glad to reassure you.</p></div>
           <div class="div-text odd-box"> <h2>Eating out</h2>    
            <p>  As restaurants, cafés and other eateries resume dine-in services, they are also ramping up sanitization procedures to ensure they are ready to welcome patrons. New rules will set limits to the number of diners admitted at any one time, and extra space between tables in support of social distancing guidelines is mandatory.</p></div>
            <div class="div-text even-box"> <h2>Get Outside</h2>
                    <p>Skip the crowds by exploring some of the fantastic outdoor adventures India has to offer. Whether that’s picnicking in the mountains or exploring the vast national parks, there’s no better way to experience India’s diverse and beautiful landscape. Connect with a tour guide to build a bespoke itinerary, and for reassurance from experts on the best places to visit.</p> </div>
             <div class="div-text odd-box"> <h2>Look out for deals</h2>
                <p> The travel industry is gearing up to welcome tourists again, and to smooth the path for holiday planning. This means you’re likely to come across exciting offers and deals, special rates and new suggestions of how to experience and enjoy India.</p> </div>
